# Interview with Client Transcript

**Sam:** Good evening Arsh, I hope you are doing well. Could you please introduce yourself and introduce your experience organising and participating in debate tournaments?

**Arsh:** So, hi, my name is Arsh. I'm a Grade 11 student and I've participated in debate competitions for over four years now. For the past few years, they have been virtual. I'm a newbie to organising debate tournaments, but I'm getting there.

**Sam:** Awesome. Thank you for that Arsh. The next question I'd like to ask you is when organising debate competitions, what technology are you currently using?

**Arsh:** Okay, so to get participants in, we normally use a type of form system. So probably just Google Forms because it's so easy to use. Then to collect payments, since we are in Singapore, we use PayNow. And then for promotion, there are some Facebook groups that we contact. So we get participants, but it gets annoying to do it because like you're copy-pasting the same message again and again. It's just a lot of time-wasting. 

We also use something called TabbyCat, which gives you the tallies of each round. It's quite helpful but it's not intuitive to use, and the user experience itself is not very nice as you have to import data from Google Forms to TabbyCat, which also takes its own sweet time. Overall, it's just a long and annoying process.

**Sam:** So you told us a bit about how you're transferring data between the services, do you have any automation to be able to help you do that with the services?

**Arsh:** No. I don't think that currently exists in the market, right? Because I don't know, I've not found any trustworthy things that actually work in terms of automation yet. They might be like charging too much, or the free system might end in a day.

**Sam:** Awesome. Yeah, that makes sense. So you also mentioned to us that you participate in debate tournaments. As a participant with all these different systems, how do you feel about that?

**Arsh:** As a participant, all of this, it's quite overwhelming. Like, there's no rigid process for each debate competition, it's kind of fluid for, however, the organisers move on to organise it, and whatever, however, they're feeling to mark it in. Since firstly, occupying competitions right now. Because some Facebook groups have gone, like, have become inactive because I COVID kills them. And then online communities as well. And then after you find those conditions, filling out the form, and then paying, it's, it seems like a lot of unnecessary paperwork, in which we have to go to different websites and login and then register, or register our team wait for a confirmation email. No.

**Sam:** Awesome. So if you don't mind, I'm just going to probe a little bit more into like, the specifics of how you do anything. So for gathering registrations, you mentioned, you use form software, often, Google Forms, what are some things you like about Google Forms?

**Arsh:** So firstly, it's an organising team, right? So the fact that everyone has access to edit a Google form, kind of makes it very useful for us. Because like, we can assign people stuff to do. And then we can also check upon them. We don't have to wait for them to reply to our message and be like, Oh, can we see the form before you send it out? Or we can just go to Google Forms and look at it. And it's intuitive to add the question it takes, it's kind of efficient to do it as well. It doesn't take much time to add a question. And then like a multiple-choice or like a short line answer. It's just a click, you know.

**Sam:** Awesome. So then you mentioned for promotion, it's mostly Facebook marketing groups. 

**Arsh:** Yes.

**Sam:** Okay. And then, you mentioned for collecting payments you use PayNow, right? 

**Arsh:** Yeah. 

**Sam:** Could I ask how do you kind of feel about that system? You've mentioned how you've got to share the QR code. How do you feel bad about sharing it right now?

**Arsh:** Do you mean as an organiser or as a photo spend? Sorry.

**Sam:** From both perspectives. 

**Arsh:** Okay, so as an organiser, sending that detail to someone. Since like we are all teenagers, right, you're sending your bank code, it kind of gets weird. And then there are some privacy issues because like, some random 50 Teenagers would have access to your bank information. Which, which kind of like goes to the privacy reasons and all that stuff. As a participant. I've seen that more unfortunate of having a p&l account. But some people, like many participants, actually don't have a PayNow account because they don't use other banks as a bank system. It kind of restricts them to participate. For example, they're paying out alternatives Israel and from other countries that I don't have access to tell us icon participate in the competition as well.

**Sam:** Okay, thank you. And, and so, you've taught us for the, like, score on TabbyCat, right? 

**Arsh:** Yeah. 

**Sam:** Okay and then lastly, for when you're contacting participants, how do you currently do that system?

**Arsh:** Okay, so we kind of just use sometimes we use Mail automation. It depends so Google Sheets makes it easy to keep a sheet of emails, right. So we can just use Mail automation to do that. But it also depends on like, the type of email we're sending at the end of the day.

**Sam:** Okay, so do you like the mails automation process?

**Arsh:** It's kind of long, you know, if it's automation has to be shorter people and people when someone says automation, it generally means like, it's going to get done. And so he says, like, set it up. Again, you have to find add ons. You have to look at look for the ones that aren't free. It's just very annoying.

**Sam:** Okay, well, thank you so much for taking the time to do this interview. I will read over the transcript and then propose to you a possible solution to the problem. So thank you so much for taking the time.
